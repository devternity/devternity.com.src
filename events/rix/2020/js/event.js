We will design a non-trivial system and find out the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We will discuss the typical design errors, problems and solutions. We will finally learn how to create a hybrid solution, and how what to optimize our architecture for. <p>During this workshop we will be working with a C4 model. If you don’t know it, do not worry, it’s simple enough to master in 15 minutes. This workshop is technology agnostic, but we will focus on the backend architecture and services. </p><p>Surprising as it is, this workshop can also help Product Owners and Managers to communicate with their teams. At least that’s the experience we’ve had so far.</p>",

Once we move away from a single process to many services and processes, we immediately hit the problem that our services need to communicate with each other. The architect mandated REST! But then nothing worked in production. Then came events! And nothing ever completed. In this talk we'll look at the problem from a holistic perspective - take the fundamental property of autonomy for any microservice-based architecture, and design how services should communicate so that they can still achieve their purpose in the world. We'll cover basic communication patterns, where we run into problems with them, and how advanced conversational patterns can help. Finally, we'll look at some real-world scenarios for designing complex coordination and where conversation patterns can retain our autonomy and loose coupling.",

In the past there was always the conflict of DB developers vs application developers, or DBA vs developers vs testers. Nowadays developers split even more into front-end/back-end/Android/iOS/whatever else. This leads to inflated teams, inefficient communication, lack of each developer's responsibility, low team's truck factor, and inability to solve production/design problems once and for all instead of applying patches here and there. The term \"full-stack\" is often applied to developers being responsible for all aspects of their work, but XP/craftsmanship practices go further — we should also take our communication, requirements, operations, testing, etc. under control. True сraftsmen can be an order of magnitude more efficient than narrowly skilled developers. They not only write code, but solve problems. Surely you want to be one. Let's break it down and see why it works.",

Prioritizing technical debt is a hard problem as modern systems might have millions of lines of code and multiple development teams -- no-one has a holistic overview. In addition, there's always a trade-off between improving existing code versus adding new features so we need to use our time wisely. So what if we could mine the collective intelligence of all contributing programmers, and start to make decisions based on information from how the organization actually works with the code? In this presentation you'll see how easily obtained version-control data let us uncover the behavior and patterns of the development organization. This language-neutral approach lets you prioritize the parts of your system that benefit the most from improvements, so that you can balance short- and long-term goals guided by data. The specific examples are from real-world codebases like Android, the Linux Kernel, .Net Core Runtime, and more. This new perspective on software development will change how you view code.",

When you give an estimate and commit to delivering to your promise, scope creeps and enjoy estimation hell again. In this talk, you will learn how to estimate without screwing things up. I will be as practical as possible and will share the real Excel-spreadsheet that implements a simple statistical model of project estimation so you can use it for your projects the next day.",

Both languages can help you start quickly and deal with highly complex problems at a large scale. This talk aims to explain what makes Erlang and Elixir suitable for such tasks. We'll look past the syntax and the ecosystem, focusing instead on the concurrency model of these languages. Combining a bit of high-level theory and a couple of demos, we'll examine some important properties of Erlang/Elixir concurrency, with a special emphasis on why these properties are very relevant when building highly available systems. The talk targets experienced backend developers, but no knowledge of Erlang or Elixir is required. You will walk away from the talk with a better understanding of what distinguishes Erlang and Elixir from the rest of the pack, and why these languages are very compelling choices to power your next software system.",

With all those methodologies and technologies we should be highly effective, right? Probably not. Most of us still struggle with balancing coding speed and quality, working on the stuff that really makes a difference, and feeling constantly stressed by all the things we should learn. Effective developers don't just write clean, simple, and robust code. They also have a strong understanding of the entire development process and the problem that needs to be solved. They take time to learn, practice, and play. Learn how those developers build effective coding habits, use automations whenever needed, reserve time for deep work, and much more.

Companies seem to want to hire \"the best\", but well-balanced programmers relatively rare. Although many programmers feel confident arguing about algorithms, modularity, and scalability in design sessions, they would stand out from their peers if they also had incredible habits for managing their work, knew how to negotiate features with product owners, had intelligent conversations with project managers about the risks in their project, and understood what lies behind the irrationality of the people and systems around them. Sadly, most programmers don't appreciate the value of these skills. Others don't know how to get started learning them. I started programming computers because people are messy! I'd like to share a curated collection of concepts for you explore that will help you become irresistibly valuable to your employer or clients. I plan to share the design principles and programming techniques that amplified my skills the most over the last 20 years. In addition, I'll describe how I learned the key non-programming concepts, techniques, and approaches that have endeared me to fellow programmers, managers, and clients. I offer you a very practical approach to issues like influencing peers, negotiating with stakeholders, and adopting new ways of working safely. I'll help you start to build a personal work system that will free your mind to do your best work. I know how this might sound. I promise to share concrete techniques that you can begin applying right away. Of course, these techniques aren't magic, so you'll have to read some more and practise on your own, but you will know how to get started right away on becoming the well-balanced programmer that every manager and co-worker will love to have on their team."
