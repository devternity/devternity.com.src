Well supposedly it will. And how much is it going to cost? Not that much, especially if we’re not the ones paying the bills. It’s about time we look at the hard facts and ask those difficult questions. Are we really looking for a silver bullet? Why are we constantly riding the technology bandwagon? Where is the churn going to take us? And at what cost?",

You will gain an understanding of what Elixir brings to the table and how to build highly scale-able systems with a toolset that is actually fun to use. Even if you will never use Elixir and OTP for you projects, you will learn some of the concepts, that make Erlang into such a powerful ecosystem.",

However, nothing comes without drawbacks. There have been some controversial decisions while designing the language that affect what is convenient to do in the language and what is not so. Moreover, Kotlin is yet to deliver many of its promises, like compilation speed.

How do you find the bottlenecks when just drawing a web page requires fifty HTTP requests? What happens when one of your API consumers accidentally tries to GET your entire customer database? Most of us are familiar with the architectural style known as REST, but even experienced developers often find it difficult to translate REST's architectural principles into running code. In this talk, we'll explore the elements of REST related to hypermedia and the principle of \"hypermedia as the engine of application state\" (HATEOAS) - we'll talk about why they matter, and when you might want to implement them in your own systems. We'll look at some of the tools that exist to help you design, deliver and debug your HTTP APIs, and we'll do some hands-on coding to show you what these patterns look like in a .NET web application using the HAL hypermedia application language.",

While Node.js may not be the language of choice for building and training ML models, it is an excellent option for building the user-facing server layer that brings ML product to life. In this talk you'll learn about the ways that Node and ML can work together, whether it’s through running ML models in the browser (using WebAssembly and WebGPU) or writing a node server for an ML chatbot.",

In this talk the subject of software performance will be explored. We will focus on what is means to achieve sufficient response times, throughput, and scalability. Once the theory is out of the way we will dig into how modern hardware works and what we need to know about abstractions mapping to our software designs. These abstractions are the key to the models our code represents. The author has not meet many abstraction layers he did not enjoyed violating. There is a good reason for this. So many of our abstractions are leaky or just plain wrong.",

Join this session to see how to use Kubernetes to launch, manage, and rolling-upgrade a fleet of Java application instances with session replication. Kubernetes builds on top of Docker to construct a clustered container scheduling service. Kubernetes enables users to ask a cluster to run a set of containers. The system will automatically pick worker nodes to run those containers on, which we think of more as “scheduling” than “orchestration”. Kubernetes also provides ways for containers to find and communicate with each other and ways to manage both tightly coupled and loosely coupled sets of cooperating containers. In this session, you’ll learn: how to containerize different Java-based microservice workloads using Docker and different build tool plugins, deploying and managing a fleet of Java-based microservices in Kubernetes, service discovery 101 in Kubernetes, how to perform critical DevOps steps, such as canary, rolling update, roll backs, and some tips and tricks!"
